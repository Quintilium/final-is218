Business Description

Retro Oasis
Our business is a retro arcade complex that focuses on providing a comfortable environment that people come to remember their childhood games. Our archetype is Everyman, since we strive to provide a sense of belonging for every customer. We’ll be using consistency, reciprocity, liking, and some scarcity. “Jose” is a fan of retro games, but he finds that there’s no nearby arcade places that create a community focused on retro gaming. He feels something missing, has tried going to places that offer game services, but none of them feel comfortable enough to stay or is mostly empty. So at “Retro Oasis,” the mission is to provide hard to get retro games, while building a community around it. We plan to work by monthly subscription for access to all of our locations, rentals for consoles, exclusive merch, and access to tournaments. This way, the Retro Oasis membership becomes a way for people to connect with themselves as well as other people passionate about retro games.
