1) We have Yestercades, River City Gaming, and Eight On the Break as competitors

2) Our strengths are a diverse amount of games that attract a large audience, our weakness is the prizes need a tricky balance of cost. Our opportunities are using reviews of other arcades to better select games for our audience. Our threats are other arcades that have more money to get better games to take customers away
